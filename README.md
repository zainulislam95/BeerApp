# BeerApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone, build, and run the project:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or later)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (version 19.2.8 or later)

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zainulislam95/BeerApp
cd BeerApp
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Note: Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
